# ONS_background
The background for ONS digital has spheres and other iconography. 

As part of a fun and whimsical side project I would like to animate them in order to further my skills in javascript and to test vibe coding.

# How to use

1. [Visit the ONS Background site here](https://felixim0.github.io/ONS_background/)

2. [Download OBS](https://obsproject.com/download)

3. [Download NVIDIA Broadcast](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/)

4. Setup

Use NVIDIA Broadcast to "remove background" on your webcam.

Setup OBS to use your NVIDIA Broadcast camera output.

Setup OBS to use https://felixim0.github.io/ONS_background/ as a website background.

You can then use the "Interact" option in OBS to change the ball animations, speed, toggle the menu visiblity on or off.

If you place the webcam input in OBS in the usual position, then the UI should be hidden by your own picture, allowing you to see and update the balls live, without anyone seeing in teams/meet/etc.
