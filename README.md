# ONS_background
The background for ONS digital has spheres and other iconography. 

As part of a fun and whimsical side project I would like to animate them in order to further my skills in javascript and to test vibe coding.

## TODO
* [] Add "ball breaker" option to make more balls on button press
* [] Add "reset" keyboard shortcut to reset all balls to initial state
* [] Create "GitHub" pages for the background 
* [] Make a PWA 

## TODO - Extras (feel free to PR these fixes)
* [] Add TODO - Extras requirements!
